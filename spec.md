SportsPodium Pre-Tokensale on Steemit 23 - 30 August 2017 - How will it work?

> As per our announcement on Saturday we are looking forward to the pre-token sale right here on Steemit.  As a reminder:

> As a user of Steemit, you have a limited chance to buy PODS for three days before the Token Sale (ICO) of SportsPodium Starts. We will give a massive discount on the value of these tokens to the Steem community, but we will limit the tokens available to US $500 000 of value in Steem. This we do to be fair to the broader crypto community.**
 
# Why are we doing this?
1.Our founders have been involved on this platform since the early days of Steemit. 
2.We understand that a lot of the Steemit community is not necessarily Crypto Traders or Crypto technology specialists.  We therefor want to give you the opportunity to get your hands on some pods in an easy non-technology driven way.  
3.We want to give the tech savy crypto traders the opportunity to get their hands at a special bonus price.
4.One of our target markets, is the sporting supporter community.  We want to work with Steemit to build our blogging side of the SportsPodium solutio, right here on Steemit and we hope to bring thousands of new users to the platform. The mechanics and options around exactly how this is not clear right now, and we will only start working on that after our Token sale is complete.
1.In short this is our way to thank the Steemit community.
 
# Our transparent Process
 
We want to ensure that all stakeholders are comfortable and the process is transparent.  We will accept both Steem and Steem Dollars in exchange for Pods.  Again, to be fair to the broader crypto community the cost for Pods will be based on the same principle as the token sale which is of 2000 Pods for 1 Ethereum.  You will however during the Pre-Token Sale be awarded a 50% bonus. For example you will get  2000 Pods + 1000 Pods for 1 Ethereum.   We will record the Ethereum price at the time of your purchase and do a direct conversion against the Ethereum vs Steem and/or Ethereum vs Steem Dolar price and we will use the CoinMarketCap website's [API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) for the conversion.
 
## Example:
Example based on the prices quoted on CoinMarketcap.com at the time of writing this article.
 
1.Ethereum price point :  $288.11
2.Steem Price : $1.12
3.Steem Dollar Price: $0,96
 
## Example using Steem
 
Should you exchange 150 Steem for Pods based on the pricing above:
 
>1 Ethereum = 2000 Pods
>1 Ethereum = 257,2411 Steem
>257,2411 Steem = 2000 Pods
>Exchange 150 Steem for Pods = 1166,221 Pods
>Bonus Percentage for tokensale period: 50% 
>Bonus Pods = 583,1106 Pods
>Total Pods Received for 150 Steem : 1749,322
 
## Example using Steem Dollars
 
Should you exchange 150 Steem Dollar for Pods based on the pricing above:
 
>1 Ethereum = 2000 Pods
>1 Ethereum = 300,1145833 Steem Dollars
>257,2411 Steem = 2000 Pods
>Exchange 150 Steem for Pods = 999,6182014 Pods
>Bonus Percentage for tokensale period: 50% 
>Bonus Pods = 499,8091007 Pods
>Total Pods Received for 150 Steem : 1499,427302
 
# How will this work?
1.The token sale will be based on the Sportspodium.io website and will run from 21 August 12:00 AM UCT - 25 August 2017 23:59 UCT.
2.You will need to register for the Pre token sale using with Name(Optional) and Steemit Account name to ensure we can capture and record your purchase.
3.You will transfer your Steem or Steem Dollar to the @sportspodium Steem Wallet using a specifically designed interface on our website.  The transfer will be captured on the Steem Blockchain and we are also keeping a record within a separate database.  This is to ensure that we can issue your Pod Tokens into your Pods Wallet as soon as our Blockchain is operational.
4.We do not capture or use your private keys
5.We will capture the following fields in our database:
6.Steemit Username
7.Amount Steem / Steem Dollars transferred
8.Ethereum Price at time of transfer (For Exchange Rate Conversion purposes)
9.Date / Time
10.Number of Pods Issued (Based on the conversion rate against the Ethereum Price)
 
* The following will be captured in the Steem Blockchain as we are using the Steem Transfer code in our website.
transfer "<from_account>" "sportspodium" "<amount> SBD" "<memo_message>" true
 
1.Steemit Username (From Account)
2.@SportsPodium (To Account)
3.Amount SBD or STEEM
4.Memo Message (Number of Pods issued based on the Ethereum Conversion Rate at the time of Transfer)
 
Your pods will be issued directly into your Pods Wallet on the SportsPodium Blockchain at the end of the main token sale.    
 
#Using generic Steem wallet transfer (as opposed to our website)

You will still be able to do a transfer using the standard Transfer to Account Functionality within your Steem wallet. This is acceptable but we will not be able to record the amount of Pods issued in the memo field on the Steem Blockchain.  We will however create the accounts on the SportsPodium Blockchain using an extract from the Steem Blockchain for all transfers made into the SportsPodium Steem Accounts during the time of the Pre Token Sale.  In order to issue you with the appropriate amount of Pods, we will use a conversion rate of the average rate of Ethereum from all other purchases during the token sale. 
 
We do recommend that you use the SportsPodium website for the transfer as we keep an audit trail of all transactions in the database. You will be able to see the progress on our website, www.sportspodium.io and we will do an update post on the progress every day during the pre-token sale.
